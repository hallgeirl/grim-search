# Install scripts

**WARNING** -- the scripts in this directory is VERY rudimentary and is used at your own risk.

## Installing Grim Search on Linux
Run `install-linux.sh` as root/sudo:

```sudo ./install-linux.sh ```

This will grab the latest release of Grim Search, and install it to `/usr/share/grimsearch`, and create a shortcut in the desktop manager to launch it.

## Installing Grim Search on Windows
No support for any automated installation as of now. Just extract the zip and run the .exe instead.
