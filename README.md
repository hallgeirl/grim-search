# Grim Dawn Item Search

Someone that has played Grim Dawn for a while may start losing track of all his or her items across the various characters, mules and stashes. This application aims to resolve this by allowing you to search for items, based on item names, certain stats, as well as filtering based on quality, level requirements and item types. Additionally, you can easily find out what items on a particular character is also found on others.

## First time setup
Go to the Settings tab to configure your save paths and path to Grim Dawn. If you run Grim Dawn on Steam, things are rather simple: Just fire up Steam (it must be running), then just click "Detect settings from running Steam process" to detect the paths automatically. If you are NOT running on Steam, or this fails for some reason (if so: please submit an issue), you will have to enter the paths manually.

## Searching for items
Simply type the item name, or parts of it, in the search box. You can also search by character name or certain stats. Filters are available as well.

## Search for duplicate items across characters
From the dropdown, choose "Duplicate search" instead of "Regular search" and type in the full character name.
