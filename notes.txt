Detecting GD folder on linux:
- read ~/.steam$ cat registry.vdf to get steam install folder e.g. ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/sourcemods (so steam folder is ~/.steam/debian-installation)
- get libraryfolders.vdf from steam folder (e.g. ~/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf) and find the library for the game id (219990)

- for saves: find userid by checking list of folders in ~/.steam/steam/userdata
- save folder would be: /.steam/debian-installation/userdata/<userid>/219990/remote/save
