# Install scripts

**WARNING** -- the scripts in this directory is VERY rudimentary and is used at your own risk.

## Installing Grim Search on Linux
Run `install-linux.sh` with the zip file from the Grim Search release as the argument:

```sudo ./install-linux.sh ~/Downloads/grimsearch-linux-x64-0.3.0.zip```

This will install Grim Search to `/usr/share/grimsearch`, and create a shortcut in the desktop manager to launch it.

## Installing Grim Search on Windows
No support for this as of now. Just extract the zip and run the .exe instead.
